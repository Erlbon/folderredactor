REM Builds everything a release publishes, with this repo's own .venv:
REM   dist\folderredactor.exe        the one-file program (the portable download; update channel windows-exe)
REM   dist\folderredactor-setup.exe  the per-user installer around the one-folder build (channel windows-installer)
REM Run this from a Windows machine with Python 3.11+ and Inno Setup 6 (https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php; a per-user
REM install is enough).
REM
REM Checks the result of every step and stops with a clear message on
REM failure, instead of continuing to a false "Done" message.
REM
REM Does NOT bump the version number -- run bump_version.py yourself
REM first if this build should carry a new version. Does not publish anything either: a release is made with
REM .venv\Scripts\python -m redactor_common.release publish (pyproject.toml), which runs this with --no-pause.
